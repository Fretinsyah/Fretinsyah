## 👤 Profile
I am a Cyber Security student with a strong interest in offensive security,
particularly in OSINT, web exploitation, and cryptography. I also work as a
Junior Web Developer at BPPTIK Komdigi, where I gain hands-on experience
in building and maintaining web-based applications.

I am passionate about understanding how systems work, identifying security
weaknesses, and applying structured methodologies in both development and
security analysis.
